Weka exception: Can't open file /poc/model/1_20141030_0841_19620.mdl (No such file or directory).

General options:

-h or -help
	Output help information.
-synopsis or -info
	Output synopsis for classifier (use in conjunction  with -h)
-t <name of training file>
	Sets training file.
-T <name of test file>
	Sets test file. If missing, a cross-validation will be performed
	on the training data.
-c <class index>
	Sets index of class attribute (default: last).
-x <number of folds>
	Sets number of folds for cross-validation (default: 10).
-no-cv
	Do not perform any cross validation.
-split-percentage <percentage>
	Sets the percentage for the train/test set split, e.g., 66.
-preserve-order
	Preserves the order in the percentage split.
-s <random number seed>
	Sets random number seed for cross-validation or percentage split
	(default: 1).
-m <name of file with cost matrix>
	Sets file with cost matrix.
-l <name of input file>
	Sets model input file. In case the filename ends with '.xml',
	a PMML file is loaded or, if that fails, options are loaded
	from the XML file.
-d <name of output file>
	Sets model output file. In case the filename ends with '.xml',
	only the options are saved to the XML file, not the model.
-v
	Outputs no statistics for training data.
-o
	Outputs statistics only, not the classifier.
-i
	Outputs detailed information-retrieval statistics for each class.
-k
	Outputs information-theoretic statistics.
-p <attribute range>
	Only outputs predictions for test instances (or the train
	instances if no test instances provided and -no-cv is used),
	along with attributes (0 for none).
-distribution
	Outputs the distribution instead of only the prediction
	in conjunction with the '-p' option (only nominal classes).
-r
	Only outputs cumulative margin distribution.
-xml filename | xml-string
	Retrieves the options from the XML-data instead of the command line.
-threshold-file <file>
	The file to save the threshold data to.
	The format is determined by the extensions, e.g., '.arff' for ARFF 
	format or '.csv' for CSV.
-threshold-label <label>
	The class label to determine the threshold data for
	(default is the first label)

Options specific to weka.classifiers.functions.SMO:

-D
	If set, classifier is run in debug mode and
	may output additional info to the console
-no-checks
	Turns off all checks - use with caution!
	Turning them off assumes that data is purely numeric, doesn't
	contain any missing values, and has a nominal class. Turning them
	off also means that no header information will be stored if the
	machine is linear. Finally, it also assumes that no instance has
	a weight equal to 0.
	(default: checks on)
-C <double>
	The complexity constant C. (default 1)
-N
	Whether to 0=normalize/1=standardize/2=neither. (default 0=normalize)
-L <double>
	The tolerance parameter. (default 1.0e-3)
-P <double>
	The epsilon for round-off error. (default 1.0e-12)
-M
	Fit logistic models to SVM outputs. 
-V <double>
	The number of folds for the internal
	cross-validation. (default -1, use training data)
-W <double>
	The random number seed. (default 1)
-K <classname and parameters>
	The Kernel to use.
	(default: weka.classifiers.functions.supportVector.PolyKernel)

Options specific to kernel weka.classifiers.functions.supportVector.PolyKernel:

-D
	Enables debugging output (if available) to be printed.
	(default: off)
-no-checks
	Turns off all checks - use with caution!
	(default: checks on)
-C <num>
	The size of the cache (a prime number), 0 for full cache and 
	-1 to turn it off.
	(default: 250007)
-E <num>
	The Exponent to use.
	(default: 1.0)
-L
	Use lower-order terms.
	(default: no)
