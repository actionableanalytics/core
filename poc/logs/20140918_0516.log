General options:

-h or -help
	Output help information.
-synopsis or -info
	Output synopsis for classifier (use in conjunction  with -h)
-t <name of training file>
	Sets training file.
-T <name of test file>
	Sets test file. If missing, a cross-validation will be performed
	on the training data.
-c <class index>
	Sets index of class attribute (default: last).
-x <number of folds>
	Sets number of folds for cross-validation (default: 10).
-no-cv
	Do not perform any cross validation.
-split-percentage <percentage>
	Sets the percentage for the train/test set split, e.g., 66.
-preserve-order
	Preserves the order in the percentage split.
-s <random number seed>
	Sets random number seed for cross-validation or percentage split
	(default: 1).
-m <name of file with cost matrix>
	Sets file with cost matrix.
-l <name of input file>
	Sets model input file. In case the filename ends with '.xml',
	a PMML file is loaded or, if that fails, options are loaded
	from the XML file.
-d <name of output file>
	Sets model output file. In case the filename ends with '.xml',
	only the options are saved to the XML file, not the model.
-v
	Outputs no statistics for training data.
-o
	Outputs statistics only, not the classifier.
-i
	Outputs detailed information-retrieval statistics for each class.
-k
	Outputs information-theoretic statistics.
-p <attribute range>
	Only outputs predictions for test instances (or the train
	instances if no test instances provided and -no-cv is used),
	along with attributes (0 for none).
-distribution
	Outputs the distribution instead of only the prediction
	in conjunction with the '-p' option (only nominal classes).
-r
	Only outputs cumulative margin distribution.
-z <class name>
	Only outputs the source representation of the classifier,
	giving it the supplied name.
-g
	Only outputs the graph representation of the classifier.
-xml filename | xml-string
	Retrieves the options from the XML-data instead of the command line.
-threshold-file <file>
	The file to save the threshold data to.
	The format is determined by the extensions, e.g., '.arff' for ARFF 
	format or '.csv' for CSV.
-threshold-label <label>
	The class label to determine the threshold data for
	(default is the first label)

Options specific to weka.classifiers.trees.J48:

-U
	Use unpruned tree.
-C <pruning confidence>
	Set confidence threshold for pruning.
	(default 0.25)
-M <minimum number of instances>
	Set minimum number of instances per leaf.
	(default 2)
-R
	Use reduced error pruning.
-N <number of folds>
	Set number of folds for reduced error
	pruning. One fold is used as pruning set.
	(default 3)
-B
	Use binary splits only.
-S
	Don't perform subtree raising.
-L
	Do not clean up after the tree has been built.
-A
	Laplace smoothing for predicted probabilities.
-Q <seed>
	Seed for random data shuffling (default 1).
